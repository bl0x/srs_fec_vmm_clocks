srs_fec_vmm_clocks
==================

This repository contains schematics showing clock signal distribution within the SRS FEC and VMM hybrid firmware.

The SRS (scalable readout system) FEC (front-end controller) and the VMM hybrid module are developed by the [GDD](https://gdd.web.cern.ch/) group at CERN. The VMM ASIC is developed at [BNL](https://www.bnl.gov/omega/).

The schematics are made using the excellent graph editor [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed).

To produce PDF files from the graphml, do the following:

* open file with yEd
* from the menu choose 'File -> Export...'
* choose 'PDF' as format and save
